# 
# 1. Zomato is mostly used in India
# 2. In USA, they just have a website, which they will recommend some kind of restaurants.
# 3. Main base of Zomato is in India
#

# Observation-
# 1. Most Revenue is generated in India 
# 2. Max sales in India is approx is 94.32%
# 3. In United States max sales approx is 4.73%
# 4. In United Kingdom max sales approx is 0.87%
# 
# These are the top 3 countries, most of his business is in India

# ### The survey seems to have spread across15 countries. This shows that Zomato is a multinational company having actives business in all those countries.

# As Zomato is a startup from India hence it makes sense that it has maximum business spread across restaurants in India

# # Understanding the Rating aggregate, color and text

# In[26]:


ratings=zomato_final.groupby(['Aggregate rating','Rating color','Rating text']).size().reset_index()
ratings
# Check the ratings


# In[27]:


#We have rename the columns ---wherever there is 0 in column it will rename it to Counts
final_ratings=ratings.rename(columns={0:'Counts'})


# In[28]:


final_ratings


# In[29]:


final_ratings.head()


# Observation: 
#     
# The above information helps us to understand the realation between Aggregate rating, color and text. We conclude the following color assigned to the ratings:
# 1. Rating 0 - White - Not rated
# 2. Rating 1.8 to 2.4 - Red - Poor
# 3. Rating 2.5 to 3.4 - Orange - Average
# 4. Rating 3.5 to 3.9 - Yellow - Good
# 5. Rating 4.0 to 4.4 - Green - Very Good
# 6. Rating 4.5 to 4.9 - Dark Green - Excellent
# 

# # We will plot these ratings in a better way so that we can understand in a visualized form

# Observation:
# 1. 0 rating is more than 2000
# 2. Top rated is 4.9 rating
# 2. it looks like a Guasian curve i.e Normal distribution

Observation:
India seems to have maximum unrated restaurants.
# # Let us try to understand the coverage of city

# In[34]:

# # From which New Delhi Locality maximum restaurants are listed in Zomato

#plt.ylabel(None);

plt.title('Resturants Listing on Zomato from New Delhi');

Observation:
Connaught place seems to have a high no of restaurants registered with Zomato, 
Now,Let us understand the cuisines the top-rated restaurants have to offer.
# # What kind of Cuisine these highly rates resturants offer

# In[45]:


# Achieve this by the following steps

## Fetching the resturants having 'Excellent' and 'Very Good' rating
ConnaughtPlace = Delhi[(Delhi.Locality.isin(['Connaught Place'])) & (Delhi['Rating text'].isin(['Excellent','Very Good']))]

ConnaughtPlace = ConnaughtPlace.Cuisines.value_counts().reset_index()

Cuisine


# In[37]:


zomato_final["Cuisines"].value_counts()[:20].sort_values(ascending=False)


# Observation: 
# 
# Top rated resturants seems to be doing well in the following cuisene
# 1. North Indian
# 2. Chinese
# 3. Fast Food
# 4. Mughlai

# # How many of such resturants accept online delivery

# In[48]:


top_locality = Delhi.Locality.value_counts().head(10) #Top 10 localities
sns.set_theme(style="darkgrid")
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
#Show the counts of observations in each categorical bin using bars.
online_delivery= sns.countplot(y= "Locality", hue="Has Online delivery", data=Delhi[Delhi.Locality.isin(top_locality.index)])
plt.title('Resturants Online Delivery');

Observation:

Apart from Shahdara locality, restaurants in other localities accept online delivery.


Online Delivery seems to be on the higher side in Defence colony and Connaught Place.
# # Rating VS Cost of dinning

# In[39]:


plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
sns.scatterplot(x="Average Cost for two", y="Aggregate rating", hue='Price range', data=Delhi)

plt.xlabel("Average Cost for two")
plt.ylabel("Aggregate rating")
plt.title('Rating vs Cost of Two');

Observation:
I observe there is no linear relation between price and rating. 
For instance, Resturants with good rating (like 4-5) have resturants with all the price range and spread across the entire X axis
# # Conclusion of the survey:
We've drawn many inferences from the survey. Here's a summary of a few of them:

1. The dataset is skewed towards India and doesnt represent the complete data of resturants worldwide.

2. Resturants rating is categorised in six categories
Not Rated
Average
Good
Very Good
Excellent
3. ConnaughtPlace have maximum resturants listed on Zomato but in terms of online delivery accpetance maliva nagar seems to be doing better.
4. The top rated resturants seems to be getting better rating on the following cuisines:
North Indian
Chinese
Fast Food
Mughlai
5. There is no relation between cost and rating. Some of the best rated resturants are low on cost and vice versa.
 The analysis is simple. The more exotic the cuisine gets the more rating it has.
